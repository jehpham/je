Hi world!

I was born in Brazil and lived there for 25 years, till the day I left to come to the USA for and Exchange Program in 2016.
Little did I know that I would find the love of my life in this adventure and go through the process of marrying him.
Now we are in 2020, already married and waiting for my Green Card to be processed and I can't believe the World is going through a serious Pandemic.
Hope that all of us will be strong enough to go through all of this chaos and that we can have our normal lives back again as soon as possible.
